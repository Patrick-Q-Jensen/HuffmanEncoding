# HuffmanEncoding

A small simpel tool for encoding a text file using Huffman Coding. The tool will read the content of the given -*i*nputFile and encode it using Huffman Coding and then write the resulting output to the given -*o*utputFile.

If the argument -*d*ecode is given the tool will instead attempt to decode the value in the input file to the original text value and write that value to the given -*o*utput file

This was created by inspiration from the coding challeng posed by Mr. John Cricket [link](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman)
